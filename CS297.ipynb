You are a international gold medalist in Math, so you should be able to solve this problem. You should expect the difficulty of the problems to be roughly at the level of a national Olympiad, although some problems are slightly easier and some are slightly harder. The problems are all in LaTeX format. Answers may require basic computations, e.g., square roots, absolute values. Provide the answer inside \\\\boxed{}. Now here is your question: ### Problem <｜User｜> two cars start from the opposite places of a main road , 150 km apart . first car runs for 25 km and takes a right turn and then runs 15 km . it then turns left and then runs for another 25 km and then takes the direction back to reach the main road . in the mean time , due to minor break down the other car has run only 35 km along the main road . what would be the distance between two cars at this point ? -------------- Provide the answer here: ### Answer <｜Assistant｜> <think>  </think> <｜end_of_sentence｜>', 'answer': '65'}\n",

The second car has only traveled 35 km along the main road. To find the distance between them, we need to calculate the displacement of each car from their starting points and then determine the straight-line distance between these two points. The first car's displacement is 25 km + 15 km + 25 km = 65 km, while the second car's displacement is 35 km. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the distance between the cars is √(65² + 35²) = √(4225 + 1225) = √5450 ≈ 73.8 km. Therefore, the distance between the two cars is approximately 73.8 kilometers.</answer>\n",
